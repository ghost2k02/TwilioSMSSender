# Twilio SMS Sender

This Python script allows you to send SMS messages using Twilio. The script takes a recipient's phone number and a message as command-line arguments and sends the SMS using the Twilio API.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, make sure you have the following:

1. **Twilio Account SID and Auth Token**: Obtain these from the [Twilio Console](https://www.twilio.com/console).
2. **Twilio Phone Number**: Get a Twilio phone number from the [Twilio Console](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/incoming).

## Installation

1. Install the Twilio Python library using `pip`:

    ```bash
    pip install twilio
    ```

2. Download or clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/twilio-sms-sender.git
    cd twilio-sms-sender
    ```

3. Open the `send.py` file and replace the following placeholders with your Twilio information:

    - `'your_account_sid'`: Replace with your Twilio Account SID.
    - `'your_auth_token'`: Replace with your Twilio Auth Token.
    - `'your_twilio_phone_number'`: Replace with your Twilio phone number.

## Usage

Run the script from the command line with the following format:

```bash
python send.py <recipient> <message>

<recipient>: The recipient's phone number (e.g., +1309399399).
<message>: The message you want to send.

EXAMPLE:

python send.py +1309399399 "Hello, friend!"

Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, make sure you have correctly replaced the Twilio placeholders and that your Twilio account is in good standing.
